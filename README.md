election-prediction-using-twitter-sentiments
==========================

In this project i have used twitter data for election prediction in UP elections 2017 using naive bayes, Support vector machine and Maximum Entropy classifier.
Also i have used modified polarity lexicon method to predict the success probability of a given party. 

Thanks to Ravikiran Janardhana (https://github.com/ravikiranj) for explaination of these classifiers and everything.
